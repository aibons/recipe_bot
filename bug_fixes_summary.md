# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
I found and fixed 3 significant bugs in the Telegram recipe bot codebase. These included logic errors, performance issues, and unsafe exception handling.

## Bug 1: Database Path Inconsistency (Logic Error)

### **Problem**
The bot's quota tracking system was completely broken due to a database path mismatch:
- Code tried to connect to `"data/usage.db"`
- Actual database file is `"bot.db"` in the root directory
- This caused quota tracking to fail silently

### **Impact**
- Users could bypass the 6-video free limit
- Database operations created a new empty database instead of using the existing one
- Revenue loss from unlimited free usage

### **Location**
Lines 142, 153, 160 in `bot.py` - all database connection calls

### **Fix Applied**
```python
# Before
with sqlite3.connect("data/usage.db") as db:

# After  
with sqlite3.connect("bot.db") as db:
```

Also removed the unnecessary `Path("data").mkdir(exist_ok=True)` line since we're using the root directory.

## Bug 2: Temporary Directory Resource Leak (Performance Issue)

### **Problem**
The video download function created temporary directories but never cleaned them up:
- `tempfile.mkdtemp()` created directories in `/tmp`
- Only individual files were deleted, not the directories
- Directories accumulated over time, consuming disk space

### **Impact**
- Gradual disk space exhaustion on the server
- Potential service outage when disk fills up
- Poor resource management

### **Location**  
Line 204 in `_sync_download()` function

### **Fix Applied**
Added proper cleanup in a `finally` block:
```python
finally:
    # Cleanup temporary directory and all its contents
    try:
        shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)
    except Exception as cleanup_error:
        log.warning(f"Failed to cleanup temp directory {temp_dir}: {cleanup_error}")
```

## Bug 3: Unsafe Exception Handling (Security/Logic Issue)

### **Problem**
The `is_supported_url()` function used a bare `except:` clause that caught ALL exceptions:
- Could catch system exceptions like `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit`
- Made debugging very difficult by hiding errors
- Violated Python best practices for exception handling

### **Impact**
- Hidden bugs and errors
- Difficult debugging and maintenance
- Potential security issues if critical exceptions are silently caught

### **Location**
Line 295 in `is_supported_url()` function

### **Fix Applied**
```python
# Before
except:
    return False

# After
except (ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError) as e:
    log.warning(f"Invalid URL format: {url}, error: {e}")
    return False
```

Now only catches specific expected exceptions and logs them for debugging.

## Summary

All three bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. **Database connectivity restored** - Quota system now works correctly
2. **Memory leak eliminated** - Temporary directories are properly cleaned up  
3. **Exception handling improved** - Better error visibility and debugging

These fixes improve the bot's reliability, performance, and maintainability while ensuring proper resource management and error handling.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test quota limiting with multiple users
2. Monitor disk usage during heavy video processing
3. Test URL validation with malformed inputs
4. Verify database operations are working correctly
